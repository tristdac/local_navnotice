Local Moodle Plugin for adding site navigation and notifications dependant on configurable user 'type'

Should work on all Boost-based themes

Identify and configure 'staff' and 'student' users with RegEx, all others are 'external' user type.

Configure site navigation items and site notifications displayed to specific user types. E.g. Nav link A for staff, nav link B for students, and notification C for guests.
